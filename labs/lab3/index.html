					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>
						This lab challenges us to learn about how files are stored and structured 
						locally, how to add and position an image, and how to use html's list feature. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
						The main problem faced was manipulating the image and other elements on the 
						screen to work in a way that looked pretty. Since "float" lets the image spill
						out of its container, I went back and forth trying to make the container larger
						or hold the image properly, ultimately resorting to manipulating the image's
						size to fit. 
					</p>
					<p>I am also currently having some problems with the image I'm using for the
						background not having its name updated in github, but that's a bigger issue
						than what I can really do here. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						I felt very good about this lab, in part because we actually started it at a 
						reasonable point in time. Having that breathing room means not desperately
						running against the clock as I'm writing this, and less stress is always best. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I personally enjoyed completely throwing out the standard list for my list of
						links after learning about tables for making the top bar. Not being bound to
						bullets or numbers makes the page feel more my own. 
					</p>
