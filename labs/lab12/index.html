					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create a function that uses conditional statements</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It took me longer than I'd like to admit to figure out the clean way I ended up with for creating div used in the output. 
						originally, I had the click function remove all of the possible classes that could be applied to the div containing
						the output, but then I remembered that creating the div with append means I can, just, give it the class when I make it. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Had I started earlier there was more I wanted to do with other Harry Potter things like your wand composition and maybe 
						what classes you'd be fit for, but alas. I also ended up not actually using conditionals in order to make my code cleaner, 
						so I'll also include some the code I used on my <a href="../../fun/photography/index.html">photography page</a> 
						for the catagory button in the slideshow we submit 
					</p>

					<button id="button">Find Your House!</button>
