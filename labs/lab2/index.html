					So I'm Michael Thomas (feel free to call me Misha. In fact from you I'd probably prefer it 
					because you're cool) and I guess the first thing about me I want to point out is that I'm 
					<b>very fucking socially awkward!</b> I know I have to talk to people in this class, 
					but that doesn't mean I'm good at approaching strangers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, due to circumstances that, frankly, were very much in my control, 
					I am writing this on my own, both the words and code.
				</p>	
				<p>
					I am fully aware that this is gonna bite me in the ass later, but it's 6:30pm on the 9th, 
					I've been trying to reach out to people, and here we are :)))))
				</p>
				<p>
					While I'm here, might as well do what I'm supposed to and write that paragraph about myself. 
					I'm a first year, but since I enjoy the subject matter and have room in my schedule, 
					I am here! Still hope I don't regret this :,) (seriously though, what makes this a higher 
					division course? It's all introductory stuff?????). When it comes to learning, I am very much a 
					"fuck around and find out" kind of guy, especially with programming. When I am bored, shit
					happens for better and (mostly) worse and that's why I animated the header.
					<span class="favcolor">Fuschia</span> is actually my favorite color, something that took me 
					wayy to long to actually realize about myself, but that's a story for another time. 
					I also really like Red Pandas (I mean have you <b>SEEN</b> one?!) and taking photos of nature. 
					If I get around to it, I might put some of my photos up here because why not?
