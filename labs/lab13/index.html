					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
						I wanted to use switch-case because it has been a while since I have and I felt that default would be pretty handy, but you apparently can't use arrays as the 
						value used for the case. I had to work around this by converting to a string. Either way, I couldn't find a way for the cases to stack in the way they needed to
						to get cases that had more than just Fizz, Buzz, or Boom. I stepped back from being overly technical to just, do the thing, but even then still ended up with
						something somewhat technical with my use of loops. That's why we're here though!
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						I'm a big fan of making scalable things after learning from mistakes I made in my Scratch years, so I wanted to challenge myself to make it easy to add new 
						rules and, as you'll see in my javascript, I made it very easy. I am very proud with the results of the good couple of hours I spent on this lab.
