					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>
						It seems like everyone had this problem, but the XKCD API has some problems with CORS that keep us from using it, so we went ahead and used a different API, 
						choosing the EPIC API from NASA. 
							<br><br>
						Of course the API doesn't return a usable link for the image src, so we had to manually reformat the date into something usable and frankenstein a usable 
						link. Luckily, the rest of the data was easy to extract and make useful! 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						Although we struggled a lot with this lab, a lot of our problems arose from things no one in the class was able to solve, not even Ilia, so I don't feel 
						at all bad for getting stuck on the XKCD API. Having to brute force the SRC link was honestly kind of fun, but should have been a problem NASA addressed 
						when making the API as it's an annoying barrier.
