			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create a function that gets a user input and sorts it. Print the sorted string</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems with the sort() action since I didn't realize it didn't need quotes in the parenthesis even though split and join did. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This has been another highlight lab! I, evidentally, finally have a way to edit my site again, so getting back into the groove was a blast!
						I made a couple of functions on my own before doing the lab, so the lab was fairly straight forward
					</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>

						<p>Let's see what your name is: </p>
						<div id = "username"></div>
						<p>Wait, did I get that right?</p>
