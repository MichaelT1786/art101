			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Using the console and JavaScript, establish a
						function, and then call back to it. 
						<br>
						use map to apply a function to all items in an array
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I personally didn't have any major issues with the lab, 
						but did help Chad with some clerical problems with 
						establishing his functions. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Honestly, this is the worst I've felt about a lab: not because it was 
						difficult, but just because I felt like I did the absolute bare
						minimum for it. I'm someone who takes pride in making things look pretty, 
						and due to procrastinating for so long, I didn't have time to doll
						up the page :(</p>
