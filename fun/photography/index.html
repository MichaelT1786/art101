		<h1>Collection</h1>
		<p>Over the course of my time as a UC Santa Cruz student, I've been collecting photos of the world around me. 
			I particularly enjoy photos that show the mix of infrastructure and nature, but I also love taking photos of anything that strikes a chord with me. 
			This collection here is the photos I like the most from my growing collection.
